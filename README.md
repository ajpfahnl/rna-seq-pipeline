# RNA-seq pipeline

This is a custom RNA-seq pipeline that I have been using to convert raw Illumina RNA-seq datasets to lists of genes
in the Tarling-Vallim lab.

## Getting Started
To execute this pipeline, you will need an account on the Hoffman2 server. I do everything in a folder `$SCRATCH/rna-seq`.

Create a folder `rna-seq/scripts` where we store all our scripts.

To see an overview of what the project directory should look like at the end, check out the directory tree [here](tree.md). 

### Downloading from Google Drive
`gdown` is a good CLI tool which you can check out [here](https://pypi.org/project/gdown/). These are the steps I used:
* `pip3 install gdown --user`
* Go to the file on Google Drive, select "Open in new window", and note the file id. For example, `https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B3Ky0L_iDa4Gp-Ood617Hr09Lsi45RJq/view` has the id `1B3Ky0L_iDa4Gp-Ood617Hr09Lsi45RJq`.
* Download the file with `gdown https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1B3Ky0L_iDa4Gp-Ood617Hr09Lsi45RJq`. Put the id after `uc?id=`.

### Skipping demultiplexing
If the data is already demultiplexed, put the data in a folder `rna-seq/03_demultiplexed` and skip the demultiplexing step.

### Setting up PATH environment variable
To set up your `PATH` environment, add these lines to add to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` file, and then enter the command `source ~/.bashrc` or `source ~/.bash_profile`:
* If demultiplexing, `PATH=~/htSeqTools/bin:$PATH`
* `export PATH=~/.local/bin:$PATH` for `cutadapt`
* `export PATH=~/hisat2-2.2.1:$PATH` for `hisat2` used later
* `export PATH=<other_path_to_search>:$PATH` for any other directories that bash should search for programs in

### More information

## 1. Demultiplexing

Multiple samples are pooled together during the sequencing run in the same lane, but given unique barcodes. Demultiplexing divides the raw reads into separate samples for analysis. We will do this using `htSeqTools`.

### Installing Sean Gallaher htSeqTools
```
curl https://bitbucket.org/gallaher/htseqtools/get/master.zip -o htSeqTools.zip
unzip htSeqTools.zip
mv gallaher* htSeqTools/
rm htSeqTools.zip
```
Make sure to add to your `$PATH` variable as described under _Getting Started_.
### Demultiplexing
#### 01_demultiplex.sh
The script assumes `$CRED` folders are located in a folder `01_qseq`. Adjust `cd` commands as necessary. \
You may also need to adjust the output path in the `demultiplexer` or `qseq2fastq` Perl scripts that you installed from `htSeqTools`. \
To run this script, use the following command:
```
qsub 01_demultiplex.sh
```
This will create a directory called `02_fastq` that contains all fastq files, and a directory called `03_demultiplexed` that contains all demultiplexed files for each lane.

Test data (options `-l h_data=16g,h_rt=48:00:00,highp -pe shared 2`):
 * User Time: 1:21:03:12
 * System Time: 00:28:25
 * Wallclock Time: 22:38:34
 * CPU: 1:21:31:37
 * Max vmem: 7.030G

## 2. Trimming
This is a necessary step because we need to trim adaptor sequences that were added on for sequencing after isolating RNA. We then remove any low quality bases based on a Q value (which is defined as the negative log of the probability the base was called incorrectly). The Q value tends to decrease (quality gets worse) towards the 3â€™ end of the read. These lower quality regions can negatively impact downstream analyses such as mapping, mutation calling, etc. We will do this using cutadapt.

### Installing cutadapt
```
module avail python
module load python/3.7.2
pip3 install --user --upgrade cutadapt
```
Make sure the `~/.local/bin` folder is added to `$PATH`.
### Trimming
Trim with the following script:
#### 02_trim.sh
Before you run the trimming, make sure that Python 3.7 is launched. An easy way to ensure this is to run the following commands:
```
alias python=python3
module load python/3.7.0
```
To run the trimming, run the following for each lane:
```
qsub -N <trim_name> 02_trim.sh <lane>
```

Test data (options: `-l h_data=4G,h_rt=2:00:00 -pe shared 4`):
 * User Time        = 05:19:24
 * System Time      = 00:08:04
 * Wallclock Time   = 00:21:54
 * CPU              = 05:27:29
 * Max vmem         = 25.011G
 
## 3. Quality Control
The purpose of quality control is to look for repetitive sequences. If it's there, it could be due to an error where the machine keeps sequencing the same fragment over and over again. As such, we need to get rid of it from the whole pool of sequences. Another issue is that maybe when trimming we didn't trim enough and kept a little of the adaptor sequences. We can check if something matches an illumina adaptor here. Lastly, we look for overrepresentation of certain base pairs at a particular position along fragment, since they should be equally divided.

### Installing FastQC
```
mkdir FastQC_reports
wget https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/fastqc_v0.11.7.zip
unzip fastqc_v0.11.7.zip
chmod 755 fastqc
```
### Running FastQC
Run this following command on a random index sample from each of the trimmed directories.
```
 ~/FastQC/fastqc --outdir=FastQC_reports ./L3_trimmed-fq/Index12_trimmed.for.fq
```
Use a program such as `scp` to copy to your local machine.
## 4. Mapping
We perform mapping using hisat2. hisat2 maps sequencing data to a single reference genome. This will allow us to infer what transcripts are being expressed. The first step is to download a reference genome.

### Obtaining Reference Genome and Gene Annotations

1. Create a directory `rna-seq/GENCODE` and download the mouse genome. 
2. Create a directory `rna-seq/GENAN` and download the associated gene annotations from the same website. This will be used later in the counting step.
#### From `ftp.ebi.ac.uk` (we will use this in the next steps)
Mouse genome:
```
wget ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/gencode/Gencode_mouse/release_M21/GRCm38.p6.genome.fa.gz
gunzip GRCm38.p6.genome.fa.gz
```
Mouse genome annotations:
```
wget ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/gencode/Gencode_mouse/release_M21/gencode.vM21.annotation.gff3.gz
gunzip gencode.vM21.annotation.gff3.gz
```
#### From `ftp.ensembl.org`
Mouse genome:
```
wget ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-99/fasta/mus_musculus/dna/Mus_musculus.GRCm38.dna.primary_assembly.fa.gz
gunzip Mus_musculus.GRCm38.dna.primary_assembly.fa.gz
```
Mouse genome annotations:
```
wget ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-99/gtf/mus_musculus/Mus_musculus.GRCm38.99.gtf.gz
gunzip Mus_musculus.GRCm38.99.gtf.gz
```

### Building an Index with hisat2
Before running, make sure you load the hisat2 module:
```
module load hisat2
```
To build from source for HISAT2 2.2.1, in your home directory `~`:
```
module purge
module load gcc/7.2.0
wget https://cloud.biohpc.swmed.edu/index.php/s/fE9QCsX3NH4QwBi/download
unzip download
rm download
make
export PATH=~/hisat2-2.2.1:$PATH
```
Sometimes hisat2 can't find the libraries or programs it needs to run. Try the following:
```
module purge
module load python/3.7.2
module load gcc/7.2.0
```
#### 03_index_build.sh 
The script builds the index with the following command (`-p` option for more cores):
```
hisat2-build GRCm38.p6.genome.fa -p 4 GRCm38
```
Test data (options: `-l h_rt=1:00:00,h_data=4G -pe shared 4`):
 * User Time        = 01:27:28
 * System Time      = 00:01:28
 * Wallclock Time   = 00:26:07
 * CPU              = 01:28:57
 * Max vmem         = 5.881G
 
### Mapping
#### 04_hisat2_map.sh
Adjust the `../../GENCODE/GRCm38` path for option `-x` to the basename of the index for the reference genome, if necessary. The basename is the name of any of the index files up to but not including the final `.1.ht2`, `.2.ht2`, etc. \
Run the script for each trimmed lane like the command below:
```
qsub -N map_L3 04_hisat2_map.sh SxaQSEQsYB051L3
```
Lastly, we can view the statistics of the alignment by checking the error output once the script has terminated.

Test data (options: `-l h_data=5G,h_rt=4:00:00 -pe shared 4`):
 * User Time        = 04:08:43
 * System Time      = 00:32:28
 * Wallclock Time   = 01:17:18
 * CPU              = 05:04:10
 * Max vmem         = 4.518G

## 5. Merging
If we have replicates, now is the time to merge the datasets together. For instance if lane 2 and lane 3 are replicates of one another, then we merge their mapped reads together. We do this using picard tools.

### Installing Picard Tools (For Latest Version)
#### Pre-Compiled
```
wget https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard/releases/download/2.21.8/picard.jar
```
#### From Source
Installing from source (I install in my home directory):
```
git clone https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard.git
cd picard/
./gradlew shadowJar
```
If necessary, load the correct version of Java. For example, at least Java 1.8 is needed for picard 2.21.8:
```
module load java/1.8.0_111
```
Test picard with with an interactive shell (not enough memory for login node):
```
qrsh -l h_rt=8:00:00,h_data=4G -pe shared 4
java -jar ~/picard/build/libs/picard.jar -h
```
### Merging
Next, we merge the sam files output from the previous step. \
Note: We can also use the built-in version of picard tools with `module load picard_tools` and omit setting the `$PICARD` variable in the script
#### 05_merge_sam.sh
We can then merge lanes (e.g. L3 and L4) using the following command as an example:
```
qsub 05_merge_sam.sh SxaQSEQsYB051L3 SxaQSEQsYB051L4 L3_L4_merge
```
Test data (`-l h_data=4G,h_rt=4:00:00 -pe shared 4`):
 * User Time        = 04:50:12
 * System Time      = 00:23:29
 * Wallclock Time   = 01:27:11
 * CPU              = 05:13:42
 * Max vmem         = 45.443G
## 6. Counting
Finally, we'll generate counts for each of the genes that we mapped our reads too. The final product will be a list of genes and their counts. We will do this using `htseq-count`.
### Download Gene Annotations
Follow the steps in _Obtaining Reference Genome and Gene Annotations_ under _4. Mapping_.

### Installing htseq-count
```
git clone https://github.com/simon-anders/htseq
cd htseq
module load python/3.7.2
python3 setup.py build install --user
```
### Counting
Load a recent version of Python 3, e.g.: `module load python/3.7.2`.
#### 06_count.sh
Adjust the gene annotation file name as necessary, and run like so:
```
qsub 06_count.sh L3_L4_merge L3_L4_counts
```
Test data (`-l h_data=6G,h_rt=3:30:00 -pe shared 8`):
 * User Time        = 12:02:04
 * System Time      = 00:06:16
 * Wallclock Time   = 02:22:55
 * CPU              = 12:08:20
 * Max vmem         = 5.428G

The resulting count files can be transferred to the local computer for downstream analyses.
